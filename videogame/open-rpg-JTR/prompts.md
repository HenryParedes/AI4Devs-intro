Outline for Developing a Web-Based Open World RPG Demo
Provide a detailed outline of steps to develop an open-world role-playing game for web browsers, focusing on character customization, landscape exploration, and creating a basic game interface.

1. The game is about a person that explores a planet with nice and beautiful landscapes
2. The user can create and customize the character: ideally choose gender and some skin colors
3. We need to create an interface in order to start the game, create the character, then load the game.
4. Assets: Provide character sprites or 3d models
5. integrate assets in project
6. based on the project requirements choose a javascript engine that suits the best

Outline for Developing a Web-Based Open World RPG Demo
Below is a detailed outline of steps to develop an open-world role-playing game for web browsers, focusing on character customization, landscape exploration, and creating a basic game interface.

Step 1: Choose a JavaScript Game Engine
To create an open-world RPG demo for web browsers, you need a robust game engine that supports 3D graphics, easy integration of assets, character customization, and interaction. A few suitable engines for this purpose are:

Babylon.js: A powerful open-source 3D engine for web development with robust support for 3D scenes, character models, and complex interactions.
Three.js: A lightweight 3D JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in a web browser.
PlayCanvas: A 3D game engine with collaborative features, suitable for real-time development and prototyping.
Given the open-world aspect and the ability to customize characters, Babylon.js is a strong choice due to its advanced 3D capabilities and broad community support.

Step 2: Design the Game Interface
To create the game's interface, consider the following components:

Main Menu: A simple page with options to start the game, create a character, or load an existing game.
Character Creation Screen: Allows users to choose gender and skin color. You can also add more customization options like hair, outfits, etc.
Game Environment: The main scene where the character explores the open world.
Using HTML and CSS, design the layout for these components.

Step 3: Create and Customize the Character
In this step, create a basic character model and integrate customization options:

Character Sprites/Models: Use free or paid 3D character models from asset stores like Unity Asset Store, Sketchfab, or TurboSquid.
Customization Options: Provide options for gender, skin color, and potentially other elements like hair and clothing.
With Babylon.js, you can easily import 3D models in various formats (like GLTF) and modify them to suit your needs. Use Babylon.js's capabilities to apply materials and textures to change skin color and other customizable elements.

Step 4: Create the Game Environment
Design an open-world environment with varied landscapes:

Environment Models: Use existing 3D assets for landscapes like mountains, forests, or lakes. Sites like Sketchfab offer a wide range of environment assets.
Integration with Babylon.js: Load the environment assets into the engine and position them in a way that creates an explorable world. Use Babylon.js's camera and controls to allow free movement within the environment.
Step 5: Integrate Assets into the Project
Once you have your character models, environment assets, and interface designed, integrate them into the project:

Game Engine Integration: Use Babylon.js to create a scene with the environment and character. Set up the camera, lighting, and controls.
Character Customization: Connect the character creation interface to the game engine, allowing users to customize their character before entering the game world.
Start/Load Game: Implement the logic for starting a new game and loading an existing one. This may require saving and loading game state.
Step 6: Test and Polish
Before launching the demo, test the game to ensure smooth gameplay and address any issues:

User Testing: Allow others to test the game to get feedback on gameplay, interface, and character customization.
Performance Optimization: Ensure the game runs smoothly in a web browser, optimizing assets and code as needed.
Debugging: Fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing.
Step 7: Finalization and Deployment
Once the game is tested and polished, deploy it to a web server or a game hosting platform:

Web Hosting: Choose a platform for hosting the game (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel).
Deployment: Deploy the project, ensuring all assets and code are accessible and properly integrated.
Accessibility and Compatibility: Test the game on different browsers and devices to ensure broad compatibility.
By following these steps, you should have a basic demo of an open-world RPG for web browsers, featuring character customization, landscape exploration, and a simple game interface.

### Second prompt
let's start developing the step 2. using Babylon.js game engine, keep code organized in multiple files and well documented

### Third prompt
Keep going with Step 3: Create and Customize the Character with realtime preview in gameCavas using Babylon.js

### Fourth prompt
Refactor createCharacter method to import fbx files from assets directory

### Fifth prompt
Next step: Add logic to start the game with the customized character

### Sixth prompt
Step 4: Implement the game environment with landscapes using existing 3D assets

### Seventh prompt
fix error: BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateCone is not a function

### Eighth prompt
Step 5 Integrate Assets into the Project: create a method that's loads a .obj file environment

### Ninth prompt
Add controls to move the character around the scene in x and z axis

En este paso se requiere un refactor para manejar el callback de la carga de assets, por tiempo no se pudo completar :(
