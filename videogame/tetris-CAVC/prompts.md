#### PROMPT:
are you familiar with the game 'tetris'?

#### CLAUDE 3:
Yes, I'm familiar with Tetris. It's a hugely popular tile-matching video game that was created by Russian software engineer Alexey Pazhitnov in 1984. Here are some key details about Tetris:

- The gameplay involves moving different shaped tetrominoes (geometric shapes made up of 4 square blocks joined together) that descend from the top of the playing field. The objective is to create horizontal lines of blocks with no gaps by rotating and positioning the falling tetrominoes.

- When a horizontal line is created, it clears from the playing field and the player earns points. The game ends when the playing field is filled to the top with tetrominoes and no new ones can enter.

- While simple in concept, Tetris rapidly increases in difficulty and speed as more lines are cleared. It requires spatial reasoning, quick reflexes and strategic planning.

- Tetris was one of the earliest huge successes in mobile gaming and provided much of the inspiration for today's popular casual and puzzle games.

- It remains beloved by millions over 35 years after its launch for its addictive gameplay and iconic music/sound effects. There are many variants and spin-offs as well.

So in summary, while very basic in visuals, Tetris pioneered many gameplay concepts still used today and remains a classic gaming experience appealing to all ages. Its influence on modern game design cannot be overstated.

#### PROMPT:
let's create a web version of tetris using using an idex.html, styles.css and script.js files. The game will be controlled with the arrow keys

#### CLAUDE 3:
Sure, we can create a basic web version of Tetris using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's how we can structure the files:

**index.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<body>
    <div id="game-board"></div>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**styles.css**

```css
#game-board {
    width: 300px;
    height: 600px;
    background-color: #ccc;
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    position: relative;
}

.game-piece {
    width: 30px;
    height: 30px;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    position: absolute;
}
```

**script.js**

```javascript
// Game Constants
const ROWS = 20;
const COLS = 10;
const BLOCK_SIZE = 30;
const LINES_PER_LEVEL = 10;

// Game Variables
let board;
let currentPiece;
let currentPosition;
let score;
let level;
let isGameOver;

// Tetromino Shapes
const SHAPES = [
    [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 1],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0]
    ],
    // Add more shapes here...
];

// Initialize the game
function init() {
    board = createBoard();
    currentPiece = getRandomPiece();
    currentPosition = { row: 0, col: Math.floor(COLS / 2) - 1 };
    score = 0;
    level = 1;
    isGameOver = false;
    drawBoard();
    drawPiece();
}

// Create the game board
function createBoard() {
    const board = [];
    for (let row = 0; row < ROWS; row++) {
        board[row] = [];
        for (let col = 0; col < COLS; col++) {
            board[row][col] = 0;
        }
    }
    return board;
}

// Get a random tetromino shape
function getRandomPiece() {
    return SHAPES[Math.floor(Math.random() * SHAPES.length)];
}

// Draw the game board
function drawBoard() {
    const boardElement = document.getElementById('game-board');
    boardElement.innerHTML = '';

    for (let row = 0; row < ROWS; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < COLS; col++) {
            const cellElement = document.createElement('div');
            cellElement.className = 'game-piece';
            cellElement.style.left = `${col * BLOCK_SIZE}px`;
            cellElement.style.top = `${row * BLOCK_SIZE}px`;
            if (board[row][col]) {
                cellElement.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
            }
            boardElement.appendChild(cellElement);
        }
    }
}

// Draw the current tetromino piece
function drawPiece() {
    const boardElement = document.getElementById('game-board');

    for (let row = 0; row < currentPiece.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < currentPiece[row].length; col++) {
            if (currentPiece[row][col]) {
                const cellElement = document.createElement('div');
                cellElement.className = 'game-piece';
                cellElement.style.left = `${(currentPosition.col + col) * BLOCK_SIZE}px`;
                cellElement.style.top = `${(currentPosition.row + row) * BLOCK_SIZE}px`;
                cellElement.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
                boardElement.appendChild(cellElement);
            }
        }
    }
}

// Handle arrow key events
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    switch (event.code) {
        case 'ArrowLeft':
            moveLeft();
            break;
        case 'ArrowRight':
            moveRight();
            break;
        case 'ArrowDown':
            moveDown();
            break;
        case 'ArrowUp':
            rotatePiece();
            break;
    }
});

// Move the piece left
function moveLeft() {
    // Implement logic to move the piece left
}

// Move the piece right
function moveRight() {
    // Implement logic to move the piece right
}

// Move the piece down
function moveDown() {
    // Implement logic to move the piece down
}

// Rotate the piece
function rotatePiece() {
    // Implement logic to rotate the piece
}

// Start the game
init();
```

This code provides a basic structure for the Tetris game. You'll need to implement the logic for moving the piece left, right, down, and rotating it. You'll also need to handle collision detection, clearing completed lines, updating the score, and detecting game over conditions.

You can start by implementing the `moveLeft`, `moveRight`, `moveDown`, and `rotatePiece` functions, and then add more functionality as needed.

Note that this is a simplified version of the game, and you may need to make adjustments and add additional features to make it more enjoyable and user-friendly.

#### PROMPT:
let's implement the move functions

#### CLAUDE 3:
Sure, let's implement the move functions for the Tetris game.

**script.js**

```javascript
// Move the piece left
function moveLeft() {
    const newPosition = { row: currentPosition.row, col: currentPosition.col - 1 };
    if (isPossibleMove(newPosition)) {
        currentPosition = newPosition;
        drawBoard();
        drawPiece();
    }
}

// Move the piece right
function moveRight() {
    const newPosition = { row: currentPosition.row, col: currentPosition.col + 1 };
    if (isPossibleMove(newPosition)) {
        currentPosition = newPosition;

    }
}

    if (isPossibleMove(newPosition)) {
        currentPosition = newPosition;
        drawBoard();
        drawPiece();
    } else {
        // Piece has landed, lock it in place and get a new piece
        lockPiece();
        currentPiece = getRandomPiece();
        currentPosition = { row: 0, col: Math.floor(COLS / 2) - 1 };
        if (!isPossibleMove(currentPosition)) {
            isGameOver = true;
            alert('Game Over!');
        }
    }
}

// Check if a move is possible
function isPossibleMove(newPosition) {
    for (let row = 0; row < currentPiece.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < currentPiece[row].length; col++) {
            if (currentPiece[row][col]) {
                const newRow = newPosition.row + row;
                const newCol = newPosition.col + col;

                // Check if the piece is out of bounds or collides with an existing block
                if (
                    newRow < 0 ||
                    newRow >= ROWS ||
                    newCol < 0 ||
                    newCol >= COLS ||
                    board[newRow][newCol]
                ) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

// Lock the current piece in place
function lockPiece() {
    for (let row = 0; row < currentPiece.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < currentPiece[row].length; col++) {
            if (currentPiece[row][col]) {
                board[currentPosition.row + row][currentPosition.col + col] = currentPiece[row][col];
            }
        }
    }
    clearLines();
}

// Clear completed lines
function clearLines() {
    let linesCleared = 0;
    for (let row = ROWS - 1; row >= 0; row--) {
        let isLineComplete = true;
        for (let col = 0; col < COLS; col++) {
            if (!board[row][col]) {
                isLineComplete = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isLineComplete) {
            linesCleared++;
            for (let r = row; r > 0; r--) {
                for (let c = 0; c < COLS; c++) {
                    board[r][c] = board[r - 1][c];
                }
            }
            row++;
        }
    }
    if (linesCleared) {
        score += (level * linesCleared * 100);
        if (score >= (level * LINES_PER_LEVEL * 100)) {
            level++;
        }
    }
    drawBoard();
    drawPiece();
}
```

Here's what we've implemented:

1. `moveLeft` and `moveRight` functions: These functions create a new position by adjusting the column value of the current position. They then check if the new position is a valid move using the `isPossibleMove` function. If the move is valid, they update the `currentPosition` and redraw the board and the piece.

2. `moveDown` function: This function creates a new position by increasing the row value of the current position. It checks if the new position is a valid move using the `isPossibleMove` function. If the move is valid, it updates the `currentPosition` and redraws the board and the piece. If the move is not valid, it means the piece has landed, so it calls the `lockPiece` function to lock the piece in place, gets a new random piece, and resets the position. If the new piece cannot be placed, it sets the `isGameOver` flag to true and displays a "Game Over" alert.

3. `isPossibleMove` function: This function checks if a given position is valid for the current piece. It iterates through each cell of the piece and checks if the new position (considering the piece's shape and the new position) is out of bounds or collides with an existing block on the board. If any cell violates these conditions, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true.

4. `lockPiece` function: This function is called when a piece has landed. It iterates through each cell of the current piece and updates the corresponding cells on the board with the piece's shape.

5. `clearLines` function: This function checks for completed lines (rows with no empty cells) from the bottom to the top of the board. If a line is complete, it removes that line by shifting all the rows above it down by one. It also updates the score based on the number of lines cleared and the current level. If the score reaches the threshold for the next level (based on `LINES_PER_LEVEL`), it increments the level. Finally, it redraws the board and the piece.

With these functions implemented, you should now be able to move the piece left, right, and down, as well as have completed lines cleared and the score and level updated accordingly.

Note that we haven't implemented the rotation functionality yet, and there might be some additional edge cases or optimizations to consider, but this should give you a good starting point for the basic gameplay mechanics.

#### PROMPT:
the piece is not moving

#### CLAUDE 3:
Ah, I apologize for the oversight. We need to call the `moveDown` function periodically to make the piece move down automatically. We can use the `setInterval` function to call `moveDown` at a regular interval.

Here's how we can modify the code:

**script.js**

```javascript
// Game Variables
let intervalId; // Variable to store the interval ID

// ...

// Initialize the game
function init() {
    // ...
    startGame();
}

// Start the game loop
function startGame() {
    intervalId = setInterval(moveDown, 1000); // Call moveDown every 1 second
}

// Move the piece down
function moveDown() {
    const newPosition = { row: currentPosition.row + 1, col: currentPosition.col };
    if (isPossibleMove(newPosition)) {
        currentPosition = newPosition;
        drawBoard();
        drawPiece();
    } else {
        // Piece has landed, lock it in place and get a new piece
        lockPiece();
        currentPiece = getRandomPiece();
        currentPosition = { row: 0, col: Math.floor(COLS / 2) - 1 };
        if (!isPossibleMove(currentPosition)) {
            isGameOver = true;
            clearInterval(intervalId); // Stop the game loop
            alert('Game Over!');
        }
    }
}

// ...
```

Here's what we've added:

1. We introduced a new variable `intervalId` to store the ID of the interval.
2. In the `init` function, we call a new function `startGame` after initializing the game state.
3. The `startGame` function sets up an interval using `setInterval` that calls the `moveDown` function every second (1000 milliseconds).
4. In the `moveDown` function, we added a `clearInterval(intervalId)` call inside the `isGameOver` condition to stop the game loop when the game is over.

With these changes, the piece should now move down automatically every second. You can adjust the interval duration (currently set to 1000 milliseconds) to make the piece move faster or slower.

Note that we haven't implemented any functionality to increase the speed as the level increases, but you can modify the interval duration based on the current level to achieve that.

#### PROMPT:
great, let's add more shapes

#### CLAUDE 3:
Sure, let's add more tetromino shapes to the game. We'll define them in the `SHAPES` array:

```javascript
// Tetromino Shapes
const SHAPES = [
    [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 1],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0]
    ],
    [
        [1, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1],
        [0, 0, 0]
    ],
    [
        [0, 0, 1],
        [1, 1, 1],
        [0, 0, 0]
    ],
    [
        [1, 1, 0],
        [0, 1, 1],
        [0, 0, 0]
    ],
    [
        [0, 1, 1],
        [1, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0]
    ],
    [
        [1, 1],
        [1, 1]
    ],
    [
        [0, 1, 0],
        [1, 1, 1],
        [0, 0, 0]
    ]
];
```

These shapes represent the 7 standard tetromino shapes:

1. I-shape (the long one)
2. J-shape
3. L-shape
4. S-shape
5. Z-shape
6. O-shape (the square)
7. T-shape

Each shape is represented as a 2D array, where `1` represents a filled block, and `0` represents an empty block.

Now, we need to update the `drawPiece` function to handle different shapes:

```javascript
// Draw the current tetromino piece
function drawPiece() {
    const boardElement = document.getElementById('game-board');

    for (let row = 0; row < currentPiece.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < currentPiece[row].length; col++) {
            if (currentPiece[row][col]) {
                const cellElement = document.createElement('div');
                cellElement.className = 'game-piece';
                cellElement.style.left = `${(currentPosition.col + col) * BLOCK_SIZE}px`;
                cellElement.style.top = `${(currentPosition.row + row) * BLOCK_SIZE}px`;
                cellElement.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
                boardElement.appendChild(cellElement);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `drawPiece` function now handles shapes of different sizes by iterating over the rows and columns of the current piece's shape.

With these changes, the game should now randomly select and display different tetromino shapes as they fall.

You can also consider adding different colors for different shapes to make the game more visually appealing. You can do this by modifying the `drawPiece` function to assign different colors based on the shape index or some other condition.

#### PROMPT:
now implement the rotatePiece function

#### CLAUDE 3:
Sure, let's implement the `rotatePiece` function to rotate the current tetromino piece clockwise.

```javascript
// Rotate the piece clockwise
function rotatePiece() {
    const newPiece = [];
    for (let row = 0; row < currentPiece.length; row++) {
        newPiece[row] = [];
    }

    for (let row = 0; row < currentPiece.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < currentPiece[row].length; col++) {
            newPiece[col][currentPiece.length - 1 - row] = currentPiece[row][col];
        }
    }

    const newPosition = { row: currentPosition.row, col: currentPosition.col };
    if (isPossibleMove({ row: currentPosition.row, col: currentPosition.col }, newPiece)) {
        currentPiece = newPiece;
        drawBoard();
        drawPiece();
    }
}

// Check if a move is possible with a given piece
function isPossibleMove(position, piece = currentPiece) {
    for (let row = 0; row < piece.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < piece[row].length; col++) {
            if (piece[row][col]) {
                const newRow = position.row + row;
                const newCol = position.col + col;

                if (
                    newRow < 0 ||
                    newRow >= ROWS ||
                    newCol < 0 ||
                    newCol >= COLS ||
                    board[newRow][newCol]
                ) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

Here's how the `rotatePiece` function works:

1. We create a new 2D array `newPiece` with the same number of rows as the current piece's shape.
2. We iterate over the rows and columns of the current piece's shape and transpose the values to rotate the shape clockwise. The formula `newPiece[col][currentPiece.length - 1 - row] = currentPiece[row][col]` performs the rotation.
3. We create a new position `newPosition` with the same row and column as the current position.
4. We call the `isPossibleMove` function with the `newPosition` and the `newPiece` to check if the rotated piece can be placed at the new position without colliding with other blocks or going out of bounds.
5. If the move is possible, we update `currentPiece` with the `newPiece`, and then redraw the board and the piece.

We also updated the `isPossibleMove` function to accept an optional `piece` parameter. If provided, it checks the given piece's shape at the specified position instead of the current piece's shape.

With these changes, you should now be able to rotate the tetromino piece clockwise by pressing the Up arrow key.

Note that we haven't implemented any checks for special cases like the I-shaped tetromino, which needs to be handled differently when rotating at the edges of the board. You might need to add additional checks or conditions to handle such cases.

#### PROMPT:
nice, now create a score system

#### CLAUDE 3:
Sure, let's implement a score system for the Tetris game. We'll update the score based on the number of lines cleared and the current level.

First, we need to modify the `clearLines` function to keep track of the number of lines cleared:

```javascript
// Clear completed lines
function clearLines() {
    let linesCleared = 0;
    for (let row = ROWS - 1; row >= 0; row--) {
        let isLineComplete = true;
        for (let col = 0; col < COLS; col++) {
            if (!board[row][col]) {
                isLineComplete = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isLineComplete) {
            linesCleared++;
            for (let r = row; r > 0; r--) {
                for (let c = 0; c < COLS; c++) {
                    board[r][c] = board[r - 1][c];
                }
            }
            row++;
        }
    }
    updateScore(linesCleared);
}
```

Next, we'll add a new function `updateScore` to calculate and update the score:

```javascript
// Update the score based on lines cleared and level
function updateScore(linesCleared) {
    const scorePerLine = [0, 40, 100, 300, 1200]; // Score values for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 lines cleared

    if (linesCleared > 0) {
        let lineScore = scorePerLine[linesCleared] * (level + 1);
        score += lineScore;

        // Check if the player has reached the next level
        if (score >= (level * LINES_PER_LEVEL * 100)) {
            level++;
        }
    }

    drawScore();
}
```

The `updateScore` function takes the number of lines cleared as an argument and calculates the score based on a predefined scoring system. In this case, we're using the following score values for the number of lines cleared:

The score is multiplied by the current level plus one, so the score increases as the player progresses to higher levels.

After calculating the line score, we add it to the total score. Then, we check if the player has reached the next level by comparing the score with the threshold score for the next level (defined by the `LINES_PER_LEVEL` constant). If the score is greater than or equal to the threshold, we increment the level.

Finally, we need to display the score on the screen. We'll create a new function `drawScore` and add a new `score-display` element to the HTML:

**index.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Tetris</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="game-container">
        <div id="game-board"></div>
        <div id="score-display">Score: 0</div>
    </div>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**styles.css**

```css
#game-container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
}

#game-board {
    width: 300px;
    height: 600px;
    background-color: #ccc;
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    position: relative;
}

.game-piece {
    width: 30px;
    height: 30px;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    position: absolute;
}

#score-display {
    margin-top: 20px;
    font-size: 24px;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

**script.js**

```javascript
// Draw the score
function drawScore() {
    const scoreDisplay = document.getElementById('score-display');
    scoreDisplay.textContent = `Score: ${score}`;
}
```

In the updated HTML, we added a new `div` element with the id `score-display` to display the score.

In the CSS, we added styles for the `game-container` and `score-display` elements to center them and position the score display below the game board.

Finally, in the JavaScript code, we added a new function `drawScore` that updates the text content of the `score-display` element with the current score.

Now, you should see the score displayed below the game board, and it should update as you clear lines and progress to higher levels.

Remember to call `drawScore()` initially in the `init` function to display the initial score of 0:

```javascript
function init() {
    board = createBoard();
    currentPiece = getRandomPiece();
    currentPosition = { row: 0, col: Math.floor(COLS / 2) - 1 };
    score = 0;
    level = 1;
    isGameOver = false;
    drawBoard();
    drawPiece();
    drawScore(); // Draw the initial score
}
```

With these changes, you should now have a fully functional score system in your Tetris game.

#### PROMPT:
finally let the user pause and continue the game, also restart it once the game is over

#### CLAUDE 3:
Sure, let's implement the pause/resume functionality and the ability to restart the game after it's over.

First, we need to add event listeners for the `keydown` event to handle the pause/resume functionality:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    switch (event.code) {
        case 'ArrowLeft':
            moveLeft();
            break;
        case 'ArrowRight':
            moveRight();
            break;
        case 'ArrowDown':
            moveDown();
            break;
        case 'ArrowUp':
            rotatePiece();
            break;
        case 'Space':
            togglePause();
            break;
    }
});
```

Now, we'll add a new variable `isPaused` to keep track of the game's pause state and a new function `togglePause` to handle pausing and resuming the game:

```javascript
// Game Variables
let intervalId;
let isPaused = false;

// ...

// Toggle pause/resume
function togglePause() {
    if (isPaused) {
        resume();
    } else {
        pause();
    }
}

// Pause the game
function pause() {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
    isPaused = true;
}

// Resume the game
function resume() {
    intervalId = setInterval(moveDown, 1000);
    isPaused = false;
}
```

In the `togglePause` function, we check the value of `isPaused`. If the game is currently paused, we call the `resume` function; otherwise, we call the `pause` function.

The `pause` function clears the interval using `clearInterval(intervalId)` and sets `isPaused` to `true`.

The `resume` function sets a new interval using `setInterval(moveDown, 1000)` and sets `isPaused` to `false`.

Now, when the user presses the Space bar, the `togglePause` function will be called, and the game will either pause or resume based on its current state.

To handle restarting the game after it's over, we'll add a new event listener for the `keydown` event with the `Enter` key:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    if (isGameOver && event.code === 'Enter') {
        restartGame();
    }
});
```

Then, we'll add a new function `restartGame` that resets the game state and starts a new game:

```javascript
// Restart the game
function restartGame() {
    init();
    startGame();
}
```

The `restartGame` function simply calls the `init` function to reset the game state and the `startGame` function to start a new game loop.

With these changes, the user can now pause and resume the game by pressing the Space bar, and if the game is over, they can restart it by pressing the Enter key.

Note that you might want to add some visual feedback or instructions to inform the user about the pause/resume and restart functionality, such as displaying a pause message or showing a "Press Enter to restart" message when the game is over.

#### PROMPT:
great, now add the instructions and visual feedback

#### CLAUDE 3:
Sounds good! Let's add some instructions and visual feedback to the game.

First, we'll create a new `div` element in the HTML to display instructions and messages:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Tetris</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="game-container">
        <div id="game-board"></div>
        <div id="score-display">Score: 0</div>
        <div id="message-display"></div>
    </div>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

In the CSS file, we'll add some styles for the `message-display` element:

```css
#message-display {
    margin-top: 20px;
    font-size: 18px;
    font-weight: bold;
    text-align: center;
}
```

Now, in the JavaScript code, we'll create a new function `displayMessage` to update the message display:

```javascript
// Display a message
function displayMessage(message) {
    const messageDisplay = document.getElementById('message-display');
    messageDisplay.textContent = message;
}
```

We'll call this function in different parts of our code to display instructions or feedback messages.

First, let's display the instructions when the game starts:

```javascript
function init() {
    // ...
    displayMessage('Use arrow keys to move and rotate. Press Space to pause/resume.');
}
```

Next, we'll display a "Paused" message when the game is paused:

```javascript
function pause() {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
    isPaused = true;
    displayMessage('Paused');
}

function resume() {
    intervalId = setInterval(moveDown, 1000);
    isPaused = false;
    displayMessage(''); // Clear the message display
}
```

Finally, we'll display a "Game Over" message and instructions to restart when the game is over:

```javascript
function moveDown() {
    // ...
    if (!isPossibleMove(currentPosition)) {
        isGameOver = true;
        clearInterval(intervalId);
        displayMessage('Game Over! Press Enter to restart.');
    }
}
```

With these changes, the game will now display instructions and feedback messages in the `message-display` element:

- When the game starts, it will show "Use arrow keys to move and rotate. Press Space to pause/resume."
- When the game is paused, it will show "Paused".
- When the game is resumed, the message display will be cleared.
- When the game is over, it will show "Game Over! Press Enter to restart."

You can further customize the messages or add additional visual feedback, such as changing the background color or adding an overlay when the game is paused or over.
